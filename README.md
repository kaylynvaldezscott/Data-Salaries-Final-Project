# Data-Salaries-Final-Project

**Submitted by** Alyshia Kiczma, Kaylyn Valdez-Scott, Nasir Qadri, and Arshdeep Khurana **Date:** 12-FEB-2024 **Project Title:** Final Project - Predicting Data Science Salaries

Purpose of the Final Project (Project 4) is to initialize, train, and evaluate a model using a data set of our choosing. We also tell a story using data visualizations through Tableau.

We began by cleaning our large data set, orginally called 'Salary_Data'. We did this by dropping null values in the columns, as well dropping columns that would not aid in our analysis. To see final data cleaned, see file labeled 'Cleaned_Salary_Data' or 'Project 4_CSV'.

We then grouped certain columns into their own dataframes in order to make analysis and visualizations clearer. We did this for columns like race, gender, and education level.

Next, we created visualizations using Tableau to analyze specific trends and information in the data. To see visualizations, visit folder labeled **'Visualization Images'**. 

For the visualizations, we explored the questions: 

- Does location impact salary?
- How do the base salaries differ amongst various titles on average?
- How much does years of experience impact the salary of any given job title?
- Is yearly compensation impacted by the number of years at a company?
- Within companies, how much does the level of the role impact total yearly compensation?
- Over time how much have the base salaries for a similar level role (of a particular company) changed?
- Does gender impact base salary or total compensation? 
- Does education level have a significant impact on salary? Ex. Does a masters equal a higher yearly salary?
- Does having a bonus impact years at the company?
- How does the base salary at one particular company compare to another? Ex. Microsoft vs. Apple?


Finally, we trained seven machine learning models in order to predict several factors in relation to average base salary. To see machine learning models, visit folder labeled **'ML images'**. Below are two examples of predictions in table format to show accuracy

**Results**

We found that there is a positive corelation between factors such as years spent at company and years of experience to average base salary. Please explore to see other factors that we investigated in relation to base salary and yearly bonus!
