# Data-Salaries-Final-Project

Submitted by Alyshia Kiczma, Kaylyn Valdez-Scott, Nasir Qadri, and Arshdeep Khurana Date: 12-FEB-2024 Project Title: Final Project - Predicting Data Science Salaries

Purpose of the Final Project (Project 4) is to initialize, train, and evaluate a model using a data set of our choosing. We also tell a story using data visualizations through Tableau.

We began by cleaning our large data set, orginally called 'Salary_Data'. We did this by dropping null values in the columns, as well dropping columns that would not aid in our analysis.

We then grouped certain columns into their own dataframes in order to make analysis and visualizations clearer. We did this for columns like race, gender, and education level.
